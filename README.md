# LiveCode

This project is an MVP of an asynchronous coding site, where multiple users can write c code and then have it compiled and run.

## Implementation

The frontend is a simple react SPA.

The backend is created in Rust primarily using axum to allow for the creation of API routes accessible from the frontend.
